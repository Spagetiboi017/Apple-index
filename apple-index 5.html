<h3>Red Delicious</h3>
<p> The Red Delicous is not at all delicious according to <a href="https://applerankings.com/">Apple Ranking.com </a>  simply because its name
lied, it was also bred to have hard skin for shipping, ( I also don't really like it either.) </p>

<p> Details: The Red delicous was ranked 25 in the Apple ranks, (which is really low ) the Red Delicous was discovered by Jesse Hiatt
in the state of Iowa in the 1870's , it was made to be "Delicous" but then mass production turned it into a non "Delicous" apple</p>


 <h3>Granny Smith</h3>
<p> The Granny Smith is a tough and sour green apple, while useful for making apple pies it was also used for making sour candy which by my standards are delicous.<br>
The Granny Smith was supposed to be the better version of Red Delicous and it was.</p>

<p> Details: The Granny Smith was ranked 57 in the Apple ranks, ( which is okay ) The Granny Smith orginated from Sydney Austrailia and got knicknamed after Maria "Granny" Smith<br>
who discovered it in 1868.</p>

<h3>HoneyCrisp</h3>
 
<p> The Honey Crisp is a sweet and crisp apple made to be quality fruit for the winters in Minnesota, The Honeycrisp was called the "Best Apple of all Time " until they had a competitor</p>
 <p> Details:The Honey Crisp was ranked 95 in the Apple ranks ( Thats really good ), if you doubt that Honey crisp tastes good try one its in Fresh Co, Sobeys, and others </p>

<h3> Golden Delicous </h3> 

<p> The Golden Delicious has a distinguished look and just like its "brother" the Red Delicious its not Delicious.(but its good in pies ) </p>
<p>Details: The Golden Delicicous was ranked 33 in the Apple ranks, (which is really low just like its "brother")</p>

<h3> Pink Lady </h3>
 <p> The Pink Lady is a nice crisp and juicy apple,Given its looks its instantly reconizible from the produce section in your grocery stores. </p>
<p> Details: The Pink Lady was ranked 86 in the Apple ranks, (Pretty good ) The Pink Lady also Originated from Austrailia Just like Granny Smith 
overall its good </p>

 <h3> Sweetango </h3>
 <p>The Sweetango is the competitor to HoneyCrisp, It is also Sweet, crisp, and flavorful. Even though the Sweetango is delicious its not worlds best and known, the reason is people already established a connection <br> with older apples that they (most likely) have grown up with</p>
<p>Details: The Sweetango was rated 97 in the apple ranks, (which is the top ) And just like its competitor it was bred in minnesota, from the same people.</p>
